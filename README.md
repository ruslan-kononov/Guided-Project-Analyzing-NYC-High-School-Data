# Guided Project: Analyzing NYC High School Data
## Academic success in high schools: What drives differences in SAT-scores across NYC?
### Motivation 
The results of the standardized SAT-exam is used by US-colleges to determine which high school graduates they admit. 
Understanding if there are any unintended patterns or reasons discriminating against certain groups of students is an important step to making the US education system more equal - something the US Department of Education states as a "formidable challenge".

The analysis seeks to answer the following question:
- Which factors drive differences in SAT-scores and thus opportunities to attend (selective) US-colleges?

### Methodology

This analysis will use descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, correlations) and data visualizations (e.g. scatter plots, bar charts, maps) to explore the following datasets on NYC high schools:

- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4'>SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt'>School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3'>Class size - Information on class size for each school</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e'>AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a'>Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j'>Demographics - Demographic information for each school</a>
- <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8'>School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school</a>

To carry out the analysis these data sets have been merged into a single, clean pandas dataframe.
